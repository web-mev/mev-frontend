   and stratification of large genomic data, particularly for RNASeq and microarray data.\n              With WebMeV platform, you can:\n              Perform RNASeq Analysis - Perform differential expression analysis\n                using RNASeq raw count data to draw biological insights.\n              Access to Public Domain Data - Directly search and pull TCGA and GEO\n                gene expression and sample attribute data in addition to private data for analysis\n              Stratify Cohorts using Clinical Attributes - Perform complex cohort\n                stratification using sophisticated regular expression, facet filter, and set operations.\n            \n\n            \n              Web MeV is being built to meet the challenge of exploring large public genomic data set and\n                Next-Generation Sequencing data with intuitive graphical interface for analysis.
